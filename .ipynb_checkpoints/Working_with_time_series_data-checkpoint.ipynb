    "#### 1. **Point Anomalies:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Point anomalies refer to isolated instances that deviate significantly from the normal pattern in the time series.\n",
    "   - **Example:** In a temperature time series, a sudden and extreme temperature spike during a winter month that is unusual for the location could be a point anomaly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Contextual Anomalies:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Contextual anomalies are anomalies that depend on the context or specific conditions in the time series data.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Consider a system monitoring network traffic. A sudden increase in data transfer during working hours may not be an anomaly, but the same increase during non-working hours could be considered a contextual anomaly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Collective Anomalies:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Collective anomalies involve a set of data instances that collectively deviate from the normal behavior in the time series.\n",
    "   - **Example:** In a manufacturing process, a group of sensors showing abnormal readings simultaneously might indicate a collective anomaly. This could signify a systemic issue affecting multiple components.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Detection Methods:\n",
    "- **Point Anomaly Detection:**\n",
    "  - Statistical methods (e.g., z-scores, standard deviations) to identify outliers.\n",
    "- **Contextual Anomaly Detection:**\n",
    "  - Requires understanding the context and defining normal behavior during specific conditions.\n",
    "- **Collective Anomaly Detection:**\n",
    "  - Techniques like clustering or pattern recognition to identify groups of anomalies occurring together.\n"
